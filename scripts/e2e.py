"""The local end-to-end tier: every test that needs this workstation, not a runner.

The contract `.claude/rules/local-e2e.md` states, which devkit's nightly `devkit-local-e2e`
job runs in this checkout: exit 0 green, anything else red, each failure printed as a
`FAILED <id>` line. It runs the tests marked `local`, which `addopts` deselects from every
other run, CI's included, because they read this workstation's signed-in Windows desktop,
which no hosted runner has.

**A skip is a failure under the scheduler** (`DEVKIT_E2E` set): the checkout is the one
the tests were written for, so nothing has a reason left to skip. By hand a skip is listed
and does not fail the run by itself.

**A run that executed nothing is red**, whoever ran it: a green from zero tests is a skip
reported as a pass.

**A fixture error is printed as `FAILED` too.** pytest's own line for one says `ERROR`,
and the failing id is what the fix pass groups by, so a fixture that could not start would
otherwise be signed by an exit code alone.

**pytest runs under the checkout's `.venv`**, else this interpreter: a VS Code task or
the scheduler may start this script with the machine's Python, which has none of the
project's packages. So this file is stdlib only (`.claude/rules/task-scripts.md`). The
junit report stays in `logs/e2e-junit.xml`.

Tested in `tests/test_e2e.py`.

Usage:
    python scripts/e2e.py                                         # the whole tier
    python scripts/e2e.py tests/test_desktop_e2e.py::test_x       # those alone, in the tier
